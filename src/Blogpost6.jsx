            <h2>Now that you are halfway through bootcamp, 
                what has been the biggest hurdle that you have gone past? 
                What do you think is going to be the next biggest thing to power through?</h2>
            <p>The biggest thing for me was getting a handle on Javascript and really undeerstanding how functions and variables work,
                but my next biggest hurdle will most likely bringing everything we've learned together into one main project. I just think that will be a challenge but a fun one lol.
            </p>
            <h2>Compared to earlier, what are three ideas you might want to do for your final project? 
                Are they the same ideas as before, or have they changed now that you understand more about 
                the technology and your limitations?</h2>
            <p> 1. A Landing Page where you can see all my projects on the page and a little preview of what each project looks like(was thinking of using iFrames)
                2. Some Kind of app that pulls all your information and allows you to do various differnt tasks all from one site/app. 
                3. An app to get your current health/vitals. 
            </p>
            <h2>What surprised you about your first week in Python and how was it different from your first week in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>The thing that suprised me was that it was easier to learn and understand how everything works together. I could see the similarities between Python and Javascript.</p>

            <h2>What are some similarities and differences you can see with JS and Python?</h2>
            <p>Some similarities are that they both do the same thing just with different syntax.</p>
            <h2>If you had started with Python instead of JS, how do you think the Bootcamp would be different? Would you have benefited?</h2>
            <p>If I had started with python I don't think it would've been bad but I personally think javascript was the best approach because it's less complex than python. Python seems easy as first glance but is really complex and has a lot of similarities to Javascript.</p>
            <h2>Think of a project or tech based tool that you use often and think about what the database structure might look like for it. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of how it works now and could you see yourself enjoying building something like that in the future?</h2>
            <p>I think of facebook or Instagram. I can see how they're database controls likes, dislikes, how many posts there are and a ton more. Yes I have a much better understanding of databases and how they work.</p>
